# Ben Viggiano

I am a second-year MS/PhD student at Stanford University, where I am fortunate to be advised by [Euan Ashley](https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/euan-ashley) and [Chris RÃ©](https://cs.stanford.edu/~chrismre/). I am primarily interested in building biology-focused [foundation models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_models), developing methods to align these models with real-world data, and finding ways to use them to advance research in biology and medicine. Prior to moving to CA, I completed my undergraduate at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where I majored in Biomedical Engineering and Computer Science.
