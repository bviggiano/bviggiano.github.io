# Ben Viggiano

I am currently a rising second year MS/PhD student at Stanford University advised by [Euan Ashley](https://med.stanford.edu/profiles/euan-ashley) and [Chris RÃ©](https://cs.stanford.edu/~chrismre/). I am primarily interested in building biology-focused [foundation models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_models) and developing methods to use these models to inform gene therapy vector design. Prior to moving to CA, I completed my undergraduate at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where I majored in Biomedical Engineering and Computer Science.
